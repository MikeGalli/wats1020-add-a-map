Basic Requirements

In order to successfully complete this assignment, you will need to fulfill the following requirements:

Take care of all the TODOs listed in the index.html file and the js/main.js file. (If you get stuck on the Leaflet.js implementation, you should consult the js/example-leaflet.js file.)
Add a carousel of images rotating to the top of the page as indicated in the index.html file.
Add a tabbed information display to the About section as indicated in the index.html file.
Enhance the styling as indicated in several places throughout the index.html file.
Add a map to the Map section as indicated in the index.html and js/main.js files.
NOTE: You can refer to the target_layout_wireframe.png file in the root of this repository to help clarify the goal layout we are trying to create.

Stretch Goals

If you wish to extend or enhance your experience this week, try going for one or more of the following goals:

Add more functionality to your map -- popup layers, draw a trail, mark interesting zones, etc.
Make your map (and entire page) mobile friendly so it looks great on iPhone (be sure to mention if you've done this so I definitely view it on a mobile device when grading).
Use Bootstrap's affix feature to make the top navigation stick to the top of the page as you scroll.
Create a "smooth scroll" effect using jQuery so when a user clicks the navigation they are smoothly transported to the proper place on the page.
Make great use of icons (glyphicons) you have available through Bootstrap (or add FontAwesome if you need more).
Make everything a lot more beautiful with your own design concept.

                   Bonus points if you go to the trouble of making nice captions
                   for the images. If you are using the Mt. Rainier images, then
                   there are readymade captions available from the Wikipedia

main.js

/* Begin by adding your on ready handler here, and then create the
   rest of your functions inside the on ready handler.
   (Note that you do not need to manually call Bootstrap functions in
   your Javascript because Bootstrap will automatically recognize your
   HTML structures and invoke the proper JS code accordingly. Be sure
   to reference the Bootstrap documentation.)
*/

// TODO: Inside of your on ready handler, invoke the Leaflet.js library
// to draw a map in your `#map-container` div.

// TODO: Add 2 layers to your map you have visuals. Use the Open Street Maps
// tiles served through the MapQuest CDN. Consult this example to set up
// the map tiles layers:


// TODO: Customize that Map to show markers with popups at no fewer than 3
// interesting locations. (You'll need to figure out the latitude/longitude for
// these locations using a mapping tool such as Google Maps.)
